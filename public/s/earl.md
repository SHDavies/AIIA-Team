Earl Dyer is a father of two and a stepfather to two other children, plus a grandpa to one. He has been clean of his addiction to alcohol and other vices since 2019. He started by going to 12-step groups for about a year before finding Addict to Athlete. Since joining AIIA, he has found a new lease on life and it has helped make him a better father, husband, brother, son, and person.

Earl has run multiple 5k and 10k races with AIIA along with countless other races on his own. He has spent time pulling "all-nighters" to support such events as the Break-The-Cycle and Count-to-County races. When Earl is not working with AIIA or helping others, he enjoys movies and television, reading and writing books, and playing DnD and other games.

In the time since he has made the ever-important decision to move forward, Earl has found how to better deal with stress at work (he is a manager for a team at eBay) and in life. He has found that burying it does nothing but leaves it lying in wait, looking for a time to erupt. He decided to become a Recovery Coach to help others realize you don't have to look like an athlete to be an athlete, to help others learn from his mess, and to prove that anyone can be a champion.
