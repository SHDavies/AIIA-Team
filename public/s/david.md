David serves as a board member for Addict II Athlete. David graduated from BYU with a degree in Neuroscience with an emphasis in exercise and wellness. He also has an abundant amount of experience in business, marketing and sales. David has participated, donated and volunteering with Addict II Athlete since 2014. He is a great athlete and has joined the team on cycling relays, running and is gearing up for his first half ironman triathlon. 

David was forced to navigate the realities of the opioid epidemic when at 9 years old he lost his dad to a battle with addiction. That changed the way he looked at everything in life. Approaching life from that perspective, he found himself chasing questions like "What does it look like when individual accountability and community responsibility collaborate to create meaningful sobriety? What is my contribution to the vision? And maybe most personally relevant, how do I create a life where I can be there for the 9 year old who wakes up to the reality that they never get to tell dad, "I love you" on the phone again, or for the teenager who, no matter how hard they play, always feels the empty seat in the stands, or for the little sister who never gets to dance with dad at her wedding?"

These questions drove David to studying Neuroscience and running a respected research lab focused on the Neurobiology of Addiction. Appreciating mesolimbic systems and dopaminergic pathways exposed him to communities who were just as passionate as he was and even more equipped to approach the challenges ahead from every circuit available for observation. During these years he found himself going to class in the morning, studying in the afternoon and volunteering at night. That's when he found AIIA. He loved the erase and replace approach that didn't identify individuals by negative stereotype behaviors but looked at people as champions in the making, capable of cultivating the skill and will to overcome. 

Life has evolved since David first joined the team to now include his wife and two beautiful children. Community contribution and professional pursuits have been meaningful to David. He has found many opportunities to get and stay involved as he truly cares about the road ahead for everyone. “This space (of creating meaningful life and meaningful sobriety) is one that I hope ends up being part of my life legacy. I am very excited and honored to serve in any capacity that I can be helpful in and look forward to always learning and serving the community.”
