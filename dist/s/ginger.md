Ginger Carter has five girls, and four grandkids. She struggled with meth addiction but was changed when Child Services took her girls away. That was the last day she used substances, which was in August of 2007. She started attending Addict To Athlete at the inception of the group, when they didnâ€™t even have an official name. AIIA, her family, and the desire to be a stronger person is what helps her stay clean.

In the years of being in Addict to Athlete, Ginger started running again, which helped her accomplish goals she never thought possible at her age. She has run multiple half marathons and countless 5k. What she enjoys the most is supporting the team, by driving the support vehicle and other service work, like volunteering at aid stations and at other Addict To Athletes events. When Ginger is not working or supporting Addict To Athlete you can find her camping, boating, and hiking with her family. 

Throughout this process Ginger has learned how to better communicate with others, feel more confident in reaching out to help those struggling, and learn skills to better help others with addiction issues. She decided to become a Recovery Coach to improve her tool box, let others see there is a better way and that anything is possible.
